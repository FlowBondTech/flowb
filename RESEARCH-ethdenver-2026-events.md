## 7. EVENT PLATFORMS USED

### Primary Platforms
| Platform | Usage | URL |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **Luma (lu.ma)** | Official side event calendar, RSVPs | https://luma.com/ethdenver |
| **Devfolio** | Hackathon registration, submissions, prizes | https://ethdenver2026.devfolio.co/ |
| **ETHDenver App** | ENS subdomain, main event registration | https://app.ethdenver.com |
| **Lemonade** | Some side event ticketing | Various |

### Secondary Platforms
| Platform | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| **Eventbrite** | Some workshop/hackathon tickets |
| **Crypto Nomads** | Side event aggregator (https://cryptonomads.org/ETHDenverSideEvents2026) |
| **CryptoEvents.global** | Event listings |
| **Farcaster/Warpcast** | Community coordination, /ethdenver channel |
| **X (Twitter)** | @EthereumDenver for announcements |

### Key Insight for FlowB
Luma is overwhelmingly the dominant platform for side event discovery and RSVPs. The eGator plugin's Luma integration is critical. Most events are:
- Free admission
- Require Luma RSVP
- Some are token-gated or invite-only
- Venues sometimes hidden until registration

---

## 8. FlowB-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

### No Published FlowB Events Found
- No results for "FlowB EthDenver" or "flowb.me ethdenver"
- No published events on Luma, Eventbrite, or other platforms
- The Flow Blockchain (different project) had significant EthDenver 2025 presence

### Opportunity Assessment for FlowB
Given the event landscape, FlowB's "crew coordination" use case is highly relevant:

1. **Pain Point Validated**: 25,000+ attendees across a massive venue complex + dozens of side events across Denver = extreme coordination challenge
2. **Luma Fragmentation**: Events spread across 100+ separate Luma pages. No unified view.
3. **Crew Use Case**: Groups of friends trying to navigate between main venue, side events, and parties need exactly what FlowB offers
4. **Key Window**: Feb 17-21 is the hot zone. Feb 18-20 are the peak days with simultaneous activities
5. **Social Proof Opportunity**: Farcaster community is active at EthDenver. /ethdenver channel exists on Warpcast

### Recommended FlowB Strategy
- Pre-load ALL Luma side events into eGator database
- Feature the 5 thematic zones as browseable categories
- Highlight "happening now" during Feb 18-20 (peak days)
- Crew check-in at key venues (main venue, Improper City, The Curtis, etc.)
- Farcaster mini app viral loop: "3 from your crew are at devtopia stage"
